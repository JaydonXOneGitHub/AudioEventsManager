# AudioEventsManager
AudioEventsManager is a two-script plugin meant for users of Godot 4.3+ (and its forks) for one to play audio based on segments.
It provides the following
- Start point of segment
- End point of segment
- Whether a segment loops
- Whether or not a segment stops the track entirely

# How to Use
1. Download and unzip the files.
2. Drop them into your Godot 4.3+ project
3. Configure a scene like this:

4. Add and remove segments to your liking

And you're essentially done!
